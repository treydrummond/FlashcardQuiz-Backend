Flashcard Quiz Backend

Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

This project supplies the necessary framwork for my Flashcard Quiz Frontend. Also included CSV file with sample data in order to jump right into running the app.

How It's Made:

Tech used: Java, Spring

I began with this project as something to display the skills that I had learned throughout my education. A Java app using a Spring framework was what was recommended to me so
I pursued it. Within the app categories are the main attraction for the time being so most of the framework was built around the interactivity with the categories and the
flashcards inside of those categories. I used an SQL database that the CSV file uploads to for Spring to then fetch from. 


Lessons Learned:

Throughout the implementation of this app I began with a design focusing on flashcards and making categories form from those flashcards. I continued down this path not
fully thinking through what I was doing and not understanding what was causing the complexities needed to pull up entire categories of flashcards. Eventually I took a step back
and realized how much easier it would be simply mapping flashcards directly to the category by assigning each a category id. I learned the importanceof mapping out the 
different pieces of structure and fully thinking the idea through before beginning implementation in order to save time in the long run.
